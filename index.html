    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a passionate AI developer with a background in NLP, machine learning, and research-driven development.
      I enjoy working on real-world problems that involve deep learning, language understanding, and multimodal AI.
      My current research focuses on argument mining in student essays using transformer-based models like BERT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously, I worked as a Systems Engineer at Infosys, contributing to data engineering pipelines and backend systems.
      I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence and enjoy building cool things with code—especially when it involves language, learning, or both.
